<p>
	The point of this game is that the <span class="red">red team</span> takes orders from the <span class="blue">blue team</span>, if the <span class="red">red team</span> does not follow these orders exactly they will be shot and killed.<br/>
	The <span class="blue">blue team</span> are referred to as <span class="blue">"CTs"</span>. <span class="red">Red team</span> are referred to as Ts.<br/>
</p>
<p>
	The last <span class="red">T</span> to follow orders (doing what everyone else has/had to do) gets a "last request", meaning they can tell <span class="blue">CTs</span> what to do.<br>
	After the process is complete, they must kill themselves, or be killed by the <span class="blue">CTs</span>.<br>
	If the <span class="red">T</span> attacks a <span class="blue">CT</span> without a reason, <span class="blue">CTs</span> may kill them.<br>
	The last request should last 90 seconds.<br>
	<span class="red">Ts</span> may not request anything that results in a freeday, hunger games, hat days, joke days, stupid shit such as making everyone type a command into console, modifying the way <span class="blue">CTs</span> give orders (unless <span class="blue">CTs</span> feel like it), or admins to use their commands, unless they feel like doing it.</b>
</p>
<ol class="center-list">
	<li>There is no "<b>warden</b>" on this server, any <span class="blue">CT</span> can give orders. If a <span class="blue">CT</span> is already giving orders, do not interrupt them or you will risk being muted/teamswitched.
	<li>The ratio of <b><span class="blue">CTs</span></b> to <span class="red">Ts</span> is 1:3, this is enforced.</li>
	<li>The command "<b>No detours or delays</b>" is implied with <b><i>every</i></b> command. If there are 2 of the order referenced (such as yellow lines), it is delaying to not go to the closest.</li>
	<li>The command "<b>AFK freeze</b>" means do not touch your keyboard or mouse. You are allowed to type into chat, use voice commands, your microphone, and heal with your medigun, <i>but not switching between healing and not healing</i>.</li>
	<li>The command "<b>freeze</b>" means do not jump, switch between crouching/standing, move in any direction, use or switch between your weapons, <b>you may switch between crouching and standing up once immediately before freezing</b>.</li>
	<li>Do <b>not</b> hint those who are alive the location of players that are missing whilst you are dead. This is called "ghosting".</li>
	<li>Cell doors are opened automatically after 50 seconds on most maps, if no orders are given, it's a freeday. You may give orders over freedays.</li>
	<li>Do not turn on friendly fire except while being a <span class="blue">CT</span><b> and</b> during <b>Hunger Games</b> / <b>Arena </b>or risk being <b>banned</b>.</li>
	<li>Orders are given considering a default TF2 configuration, including binds</b>
	<li>The only time crouching is AFK freezing is when you are forced by the map to remain crouched (e.g. on cell beds)</b></li>
	<li>First reaction/last reactionâ€“ If a first reaction action is said, the first <span class="red">T</span> to do it dies. If a last reaction action is said, the last <span class="red">T</span> to do it dies.</li>
</ol>
<header><h1 id="CT_Rules">CT Rules</h1></header>
<ol class="center-list">
	<li>You must have a working, good quality microphone.</li>
	<li>You must always be willing to give orders, this gamemode isn't only about killing people.</li>
	<li>No baiting, that means if you're in melee range with a <span class="red">T</span>, they are allowed to kill you without being killed themselves. If a <span class="blue">CTs</span> is charging at you, that is clearly rebelling and you may kill them.</li>
	<li>When a <span class="red">T</span> asks for a repeat, and you haven't already given one, you must comply. Do not give more than one, and do not give one if nobody asked for one.</li>
	<li>Do not ask for repeats.</li>
	<li>If you are <b>away</b>, you will risk being teamswitched/kicked.</li>
	<li>No armoury/vent camping. That means don't stay inside or near vents or armoury trying to defend it.</li>
	<li>No special treatment, this means allowing a specific prisoner to do anything else besides following main orders.</li>
	<li>Opinionated games are fine, but don't make it unfair, like "guess the number I'm thinking" or "what's my favourite food".</li>
	<li>When playing Simon says, you must state who is Simon and when Simon wants to play Simon says. You do not have to rename yourself to be Simon.</li>
	<li>If you are playing Keep or Pass, you <span style="text-decoration: underline">must </span>type the prize to team chat <b>prior to the <span class="red">T</span> responding</b> whether or not they want to keep or pass it.</li>
	<li>You may rush <span class="red">Ts</span> that are delaying in the obstacle course or deathrun. If they refuse to move after 10 seconds you may shoot them. The last <span class="red">T</span> to survive may run to the end without dying, as it would be a freekill otherwise.</li>
	<li>Some games are not timed, such as sweeper, therefore you must give a countdown/timelimit for these.</li>
	<li>During minigames such as keep or pass, you are not allowed to kill more than 3 <span class="red">Ts</span> at a time.</li>
	<li>Do not play the same <b>game/minigame</b> twice in a row</li>
	<li>During games such as <b>Obstacle Course, Death Run, Minefield</b> and similiar, the last <span class="blue">CTs</span> standing has to make it as far as every other <span class="blue">CTs</span> has, in order to get last request.</li>
	<li>As a <span class="blue">CT</span>, you may not kill yourself during <b>Last Request</b>.</span></li>
