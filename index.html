	In this gamemode, the <span class="red">red team</span> takes orders from the <span class="blue">blue team</span>.<br>
	If the <span class="red">red team</span> does not follow these orders exactly they will be shot and killed.<br>
	<span class="blue">blue team</span> are referred to as <span class="blue">"CTs"</span>, <span class="red">red team</span> are referred to as <span class="red">"Ts"</span>.<br>
	The ratio is <span class="blue">1</span> to <span class="red">3</span>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol class="center-list">
	<h2>General Rules</h2>
	<li><b>There is no warden on this server, any <span class="blue">CT</span> can give orders.</b> If a <span class="blue">CT</span> is already giving orders, do not interrupt them or you will risk being muted/teamswitched.
	<li><b>No detours/delays is implied with every command.</b> If there are 2 of the order referenced (such as <span class="green">yellow lines</span>), it is delaying to not go to the closest.</li>
	<li><b>Do not ghost.</b> (as a dead player, reveal alive players locations).</li>
	<li><b><span class="green">AFK freeze</span> means:</b> do not touch your keyboard or mouse. You are allowed to type into chat, use voice commands, your microphone, and heal with your medigun, but not switching between healing and not healing.</li>
	<li><b><span class="green">Freeze</span> means:</b> do not jump, switch between crouching/standing (doing it once before freezing is ok), move in any direction, use or switch between your weapons.</li>
	<li>Cell doors are opened automatically after 50 seconds on most maps, if no orders are given, it's a freeday. You may give orders over freedays.</li>
	<li>Do not turn on friendly fire except while being a <span class="blue">CT</span><b> and</b> during <span class="green">Hunger Games</span> / <span class="green">Arena</span> or risk being <b>banned</b>.</li>
	<li>Orders are given considering a default TF2 configuration, including binds</b>.</li>
	<li><span class="green">First reaction / last reaction</span> â€“ If a first reaction action is said, the first <span class="red">T</span> to do it dies. If a last reaction action is said, the last <span class="red">T</span> to do it dies.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Last Request (LR) rules</h2>
<ol>
	<li>The last <span class="red">T</span> to follow orders (doing what everyone else has/had to do) gets a "last request", meaning they can tell <span class="blue">CTs</span> what to do.</li>
	<li>The last request should last 90 seconds.</li>
	<li>After the process is complete, they must kill themselves, or be killed by the <span class="blue">CTs</span>.</li>
	<li>If the <span class="red">T</span> attacks a <span class="blue">CT</span> without a reason, <span class="blue">CTs</span> may kill them.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Ts</span> may not request anything that results in a freeday, hunger games, hat days, joke days, stupid shit such as making everyone type a command into console, modifying the way <span class="blue">CTs</span> give orders (unless they feel like it), or admins to use their commands (unless they feel like it).</li>
</ol>

<header><h1 id="CT_Rules"><span class="blue">CT</span> Rules</h1></header>
<ol class="center-list">
	<li>You must always be willing to give orders (with a good enough microphone), this gamemode isn't only about killing people.</li>
	<li><b>No baiting</b>, that means if you're in melee range with a <span class="red">T</span>, they are allowed to kill you without being killed themselves. If a <span class="red">T</span> is charging at you, that is rebelling and you may kill them.</li>
	<li>When a <span class="red">T</span> asks for a repeat, and you haven't already given one, you must comply. Do not give more than one, and do not give one if nobody asked for one.</li>
	<li>Do not ask for repeats.</li>
	<li>No <span class="green">armoury/vent</span> camping.</li>
	<li>No special treatment, this means allowing a specific prisoner to do anything else besides following main orders.</li>
	<li>Opinionated games are fine, but don't make it unfair, like "guess the number I'm thinking" or "what's my favourite food".</li>
	<li>When playing <span class="green">Simon Says</span>, you must state who is Simon and when Simon wants to play Simon says. You do not have to rename yourself.</li>
	<li>You may rush <span class="red">Ts</span> that are delaying in the <span class="green">obstacle course</span> or <span class="green">deathrun</span>. If they refuse to move after 10 seconds you may shoot them. The last <span class="red">T</span> to survive may run to the end without dying, as it would be a freekill otherwise.</li>
	<li>Some games are not timed, therefore you must give a countdown.</li>
	<li>During minigames like <span class="green">keep or pass</span>, you are not allowed to kill more than 3 <span class="red">Ts</span> at a time.</li>
	<li>During games like <span class="green">obstacle course</span>, <span class="green">deathrun</span>, etc., the last <span class="red">T</span> standing has to make it as far as every other <span class="red">T</span> has, in order to get <span class="green">Last Request</span>.</li>
	<li>Do not play the same game/minigame twice in a row.</li>
	<li>As a <span class="blue">CT</span>, you may not kill yourself during <span class="green">Last Request</span>.</li>
	<li>If you are playing Keep or Pass, you <span style="text-decoration: underline">must</span> type the prize to team chat prior to the <span class="red">T</span> responding whether or not they want to keep or pass it.</li>
